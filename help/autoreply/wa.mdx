**Auto-Reply** is a powerful automation feature that allows you to set up automatic responses in your WhatsApp inbox. When a user sends a message containing a specific keyword you've defined, AdsEra will instantly trigger a pre-written reply. This is perfect for answering frequently asked questions, starting a conversation, or guiding users to the right information 24/7.

### The Auto-Reply Creation Process

To begin, navigate to **Automation > Auto-Reply > WhatsApp** and click the **"+ New AutoReply"** button. This will launch a two-step creation wizard.

<Steps>

<Step title="Step 1: Configure the Trigger Keywords">
  This step defines *what* the user needs to say to trigger your automated response.

  #### Keywords
  - **Add Keywords:** In the "Keyword" field, type a word or phrase (e.g., `Hello`, `Pricing`, `Demo`) and click **"Add"**. You can add multiple keywords that will all trigger the same reply. The keywords will appear as chips in the list below.
  - **Remove a Keyword:** Click the `x` on any keyword chip to remove it.

  #### Message Matching Method
  This setting determines how strictly AdsEra should match the incoming message to your keywords.
  - **Fuzzy matching:** (Recommended) Allows for minor misspellings and variations. You can use the slider to set the sensitivity, with 100% being a very close match and a lower percentage being more lenient.
  - **Exact matching:** The user's message must match one of your keywords perfectly.
  - **Contains:** The user's message must contain one of your keywords anywhere within it.

  Once you've configured your keywords and matching method, click **"Next"**.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Select the Action (Reply)">
  This step defines *how* the system will respond. Here, you will select one or more **Snippets** to send as the reply.

  - **Filter and Search:** Use the **Type** dropdown and the **Search** bar to find the snippets you want to use for the reply.
  - **Select Snippets:** Click the checkbox on one or more snippet cards. 
  
  <Info>
    **Sending Multiple Snippets:** If you select multiple snippets, AdsEra will send them one after another in the order you select them, creating a sequence of replies. This is great for sending an image followed by a text message with buttons.
  </Info>

  The selected snippets will appear in a list on the right. Once you're ready, click **"Save"** to activate your new auto-reply.
</Step>
