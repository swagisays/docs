The **Templates** page is your central library for all the WhatsApp Message Templates associated with your business accounts. To initiate a conversation with a customer or to reply after the initial 24-hour window has closed, you **must** use a template that has been pre-approved by Meta.

## Filtering and Viewing Templates

To help you organize and find templates quickly, you can filter the gallery in several ways:

#### Filter by Status
Use the tabs at the top of the gallery to filter templates by their current approval status:
- **All:** Shows every template associated with the selected WABA.
- **APPROVED:** Shows only templates that are approved by Meta and ready to use.
- **PENDING:** Shows templates you have submitted that are still under review by Meta.
- **REJECTED:** Shows templates that Meta did not approve. You will need to edit and resubmit them.
- **DRAFT:** Shows templates you have started but not yet submitted for approval.

#### Filter by Category and Language
- **Category:** Use the category dropdown to filter for `Marketing`, `Utility`, or `Authentication` templates.
- **Search:** Use the search bar to find a template by its name.

## Understanding a Template Card
