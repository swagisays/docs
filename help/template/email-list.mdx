### Understanding the Template List

Your Template List displays important information about each template in an easy-to-read table format.

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | The unique internal name you've given to your template. |
| **Create** | The date and time when the template was originally created. |
| **Update** | The date and time when the template was last modified. |
| **Subject** | The email subject line associated with the template. |
| **Actions (⋮)**| A menu to perform actions like **Edit** or **Delete**. |

#### Filtering and Searching
To find a specific template quickly:
- **Search Bar:** Use the search bar at the top to find a template by its **Name** or **Subject**.
- **Date Range Filters:** Use the **Start date** and **End date** fields to narrow down your list to templates created or updated within a specific period.
