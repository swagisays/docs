#### Filtering and Searching

## Creating a New Template: Step-by-Step Guide

Clicking the **"+ New template"** button launches the creation wizard, which is broken down into two main phases: Setup and Design.

<Steps>

<Step title="Phase 1: Setup Your Template">
  The first screen focuses on the essential details of your template: its internal name and the subject line your recipients will see.

  - **Template Name:** Enter a clear and descriptive internal name. This is only for you and your team.
    *Pro Tip: Use names that reflect the template's purpose, like "Welcome Series - Email 1" or "Monthly Newsletter - August."*
    
  - **Subject Line:** Craft your subject line. To make it more engaging, click the **"Add personalization"** button to insert dynamic variables like `{{FIRSTNAME}}`.
    *Example: `Hello {{FIRSTNAME}}, here are your weekly insights!`*

  Once you've set the name and subject, click **"Next step"** to move to the design phase.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Phase 2: Choose a Design Method">
  AdsEra offers four flexible ways to design your template, catering to all needs and skill levels. Choose one of the following tabs:

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Layouts & Template Gallery">
      - **Layouts:** Start with a basic, pre-defined structure. Layouts provide a clean foundation with placeholders for you to drag and drop your own content blocks, images, and text.
      - **Template Gallery:** Browse a collection of professionally designed, pre-built templates for various use cases (e.g., newsletters, promotions). These are fully customizable and a great way to get started quickly.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="My Templates">
      Select one of your previously saved templates to edit or duplicate. This is the best option for maintaining consistent branding across your campaigns and saving time.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Code Your Own">
      For advanced users, this option provides maximum flexibility with three different editors:
      - **Email Builder:** Use our intuitive drag-and-drop editor to build a template visually.
      - **Paste your code:** Switch to the HTML editor to paste in your own custom code directly.
      - **Text builder:** A rich text editor for creating simple, text-based emails. This is great for a more personal, less-designed feel.
    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="3. Phase 3: Design Your Content">
  Once you've chosen a starting point, you'll enter the template design environment.

  - **Using the Drag & Drop Email Builder:** Drag content blocks (text, images, buttons) onto your template. Click on any block to edit its content and styling. This requires no coding knowledge.
  - **Using the HTML / Text Editor:** If you chose to paste your own code or use the text builder, you can write and format your content directly in the editor provided.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Phase 4: Save and Test Your Template">
  Once you're satisfied with your design, use the buttons at the top right of the screen.

  <CardGroup>
    <Card title="Save" icon="floppy-disk">
      Saves the template to your "My Templates" library for future use in campaigns or automations.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Save and Test" icon="paper-plane">
      **Highly Recommended!** This allows you to send a test version to a contact (like yourself) to check for typos, broken links, correct personalization, and how it renders in a real inbox.

## Pro Tips for Effective Templates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mobile-Friendly Design">
    Always keep mobile users in mind. Use responsive templates or test your custom HTML to ensure it looks great on all devices, as a majority of emails are opened on mobile.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Branding Consistency">
    Incorporate your brand's colors, logos, and fonts to maintain a consistent look and feel across all your communications. This builds recognition and trust.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs)">
    Make your CTAs prominent and easy to understand. Use action-oriented language on your buttons to tell recipients exactly what you want them to do next (e.g., "Shop Now," "Read More," "Get Your Free Trial").
