The **Contact List** page is your central hub for organizing your contacts within AdsEra. Its primary purpose is to help you create, manage, and group your contacts into customizable **Lists**. These lists are essential for sending targeted campaigns and implementing effective automation.

A key feature of AdsEra is flexibility: individual contacts can belong to multiple Lists. To keep your workspace tidy, Lists can be grouped into **Folders**, ensuring you can easily find the specific groups you need as your audience grows.

## Understanding the List Table

The main table provides key information about each of your lists:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **List Name** | The name you assigned to the list. |
| **Created At** | The date and time the list was originally created. |
| **Updated At** | The date and time the list was last modified. |
| **Folder** | The folder where the list is currently located. |
| **Contact** | The total number of contacts currently in that list. |
| **⋮ (Actions)** | A menu of actions you can perform on the list. |

<Info>
  **Performance at Scale:** The table uses **lazy loading** to handle massive datasets with ease. It loads a manageable number of lists initially and smoothly loads more as you scroll, ensuring a fast experience whether you have 10 lists or 10,000.
</Info>

## List Actions (The ⋮ Menu)

Clicking the three-dot menu on any list row reveals several actions:

- **Duplicate:** Creates an exact copy of the list, including all its current contacts.
- **Rename:** Allows you to change the name of the list.
- **Move:** Lets you move the list to a different folder.
- **Add to a Sequence:** Enrolls all contacts currently in the list into a specific automation sequence.

## Lists vs. Segments: A Quick Refresher

It's important to understand the difference between the static **Lists** you create here and the dynamic **Segments** you create from the [All Audience](/help/audiance/audiance) view.

- **Lists (Static):** A manually curated group. Contacts only get on a list if you explicitly add them (e.g., via import, form, or bulk action). The group is fixed until you change it.
- **Segments (Dynamic):** A "smart" group defined by rules. Contacts automatically enter or leave the segment as their data and behavior change to match your rules.
