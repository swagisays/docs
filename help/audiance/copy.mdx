## Step-by-Step Import Process

Follow these steps to import your contacts using the copy-paste method.


<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to the Import Screen">
From your AdsEra Dashboard, navigate to **Audience > All**. In the top-right corner, click the **Import contact** button. On the next screen, select the **Copy-Paste** method.

</Step>

<Step title="2. Format and Copy Your Data">
Before pasting, ensure your data is correctly formatted in your spreadsheet or text file.
- **Column Headers:** Your data must start with a header row (e.g., `EMAIL`, `FIRSTNAME`).
- **Comma-Separated:** Each value in a row must be separated by a comma.
- **Required & Optional Columns:** `EMAIL` is mandatory. You can also include `FIRSTNAME`, `LASTNAME`, `PHONE`, and `LANDLINE`. Any extra columns will be saved as custom attributes.

Here's an example of the expected syntax:
```csv
EMAIL,FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME,PHONE,COMPANY
emma@example.com,Emma,Dubois,33612345678,Innovate Inc.
mickael@example.com,Mickael,Parker,15555551234,Solutions Corp
```
Once formatted, select and copy your data (including the header row).
</Step>

<Step title="3. Paste Your Data">
Paste your copied data directly into the text area provided on the import screen, then click Next.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Confirm Your Data">
AdsEra will display a preview of your data in a table. Review it to ensure your columns and rows appear correctly, then click Next.
</Step>
<Step title="5. Map Your Fields">
This crucial step matches your data columns to the corresponding fields in AdsEra. The system will attempt to auto-map them.

Verify Mapping: Ensure each "Column name from imported file" is correctly matched to a "Column name on AdsEra".

Set Duplicate Handling: For each column, choose an action for updating existing contacts:

Overwrite: Replaces existing data with the new data.

Fill only if empty: Only adds data if the field is currently blank.

Skip: Ignores the new data for that field if the contact already exists.

</Step>

<Step title="6. Assign to a Contact List">
Every contact you import must be assigned to at least one list.

Select an existing list: Choose from your current contact lists.

Create a new list: Click the "Create A List" button and give your new list a name.

Once you've selected a list, click Upload.
</Step>

<Step title="7. Review the Confirmation Report">
Congratulations! Your contacts are now being imported. After processing, you'll receive a confirmation report detailing the number of successful and failed imports, along with reasons for any failures.
</Step>
