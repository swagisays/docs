**Labels** (also known as tags) are a flexible way to categorize your contacts. You can use them to mark contacts based on their status, interests, or stage in the customer journey (e.g., `LEAD`, `CUSTOMER`, `FOLLOW UP`).

**Want to Manage Contact Labels? [Go to the AdsEra Labels Page &rarr;](https://app.adsera.in/dashboard/contact/labels)**

This system is crucial for organizing your audience, running targeted campaigns, and managing conversations in the Chat Inbox.

## Managing Your Labels

The main table on this page lists all the labels you have created.

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Label** | A preview of the label, displayed in its chosen color. |
| **Create At** | The date and time the label was created. |
| **⋮ (Actions)** | A menu of actions you can perform on the label. |

#### Label Actions (The ⋮ Menu)

Clicking the three-dot menu on any label row allows you to manage it:

- **Edit:** This will open a modal allowing you to change the label's name and color.
- **Delete:** This permanently removes the label from the system.
  <Warning>
    Deleting a label will also remove it from all contacts it has been applied to. This action cannot be undone.
  </Warning>
