## Adding Contacts

Your audience table grows with your business. Here’s how to add new contacts and when to use each method:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Contact (Manual Add)">
    This is perfect for adding a single contact on the fly, like a new prospect you just met. Click the **"Create Contact"** button, fill out the form with their details, and they'll instantly appear in your table.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Import Contacts (Bulk Upload)">
    This is your go-to for adding contacts in bulk. It's essential when migrating from another platform or uploading a list of event attendees. You'll upload a CSV file and **map** the columns in your file to the corresponding attributes in AdsEra.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Core Workflow: Filter, Save, Repeat

The true power of the All Audience page lies in its filtering capabilities. This workflow allows you to find hyper-specific groups and save them for reuse.

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Apply Advanced Filters">
Click the **"Add filters"** button to open the filter builder. Here, you can create rules to segment your audience with precision.

![The Advanced Filter builder modal.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/7b3c67a5-7a34-4429-8d64-0a6da3013229_contact_filter.png)

A filter consists of three parts:
- **Attribute:** The data point you want to examine (e.g., `City`, `Last Seen Date`, `Total Spent`).
- **Condition:** The logic you want to apply (e.g., `is`, `is not`, `greater than`, `contains`).
- **Value:** The specific data you're looking for (e.g., `New York`, `30 days ago`, `500`).

You can chain rules together with **AND** (for more specific results) or **OR** (for broader results).
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Save a Filter as a Segment">
Once you've built a filter that isolates a valuable group of contacts, don't let it go to waste! Click the **"Save as Segment"** button that appears.

Give your segment a descriptive name (e.g., "Active High-Value Customers"). This new segment is **dynamic**—it will automatically update, adding or removing contacts as they meet (or no longer meet) the filter rules you set.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Load Lists or Segments">
Anytime you want to view a specific group, use the **"Load a list or a segment"** dropdown at the top of the page. This gives you one-click access to your manually created **Lists** (static groups) and your rule-based **Segments** (dynamic groups).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing and Managing the Table

Tailor the table to your needs and manage your contacts at scale.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customize Your Column View">
    Click the **"Customize column"** button to open a side panel. From here, you can:
    - **Show/Hide Columns:** Uncheck any attribute you don't need to see to reduce clutter.
    - **Reorder Columns:** Simply drag and drop the column names in the panel to reorder them in the table. Your custom view is saved automatically for your next visit.

    ![The Customize Columns side panel.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/4ce401b7-5d3a-4809-b7b6-89d53d6fc7d8_customize_column.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Perform Bulk Actions">
    Manage thousands of contacts at once.
    1.  **Select contacts** using the checkboxes on the left. Use the master checkbox in the header to select all visible contacts.
    2.  The **Bulk Actions** menu will appear at the top.
    3.  Choose an action: **Assign Tag**, **Add to List**, **Export** to CSV, **Edit** an attribute for all, or **Delete**.

    <Warning>
      The **Delete** action is permanent and cannot be undone. Use it with caution.
