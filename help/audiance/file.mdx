## Step-by-Step Import Process

Follow these simple steps to import your contacts using a file upload.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Navigate to the Import Screen">
From your AdsEra Dashboard, navigate to **Audience > All**. In the top-right corner, click the **Import contact** button. On the next screen, select the **Import contacts from a file** option.

![Selecting the File Upload import option.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/c19bd733-ec53-4443-8f9e-b6059ffa43cb_import_contact_file.png)

</Step>

<Step title="2. Upload Your File">
On the "Upload File" screen, either drag and drop your CSV or XLSX file into the designated area, or click "browse through your machine" to select it manually.

</Step>

<Step title="3. Confirm and Preview Your Data">
After a successful upload, AdsEra will display a preview of the first few rows of your data. Review the table to ensure your columns and data appear correctly, then click **Next**.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Map Fields to Platform Fields">
This crucial step matches your file's columns to the corresponding fields in AdsEra.
- **Verify Mapping:** The system will attempt to auto-map your columns. Double-check that each "Column name from imported file" is correctly matched to a "Column name on AdsEra".
- **Set Duplicate Handling:** For each column, choose an action for updating existing contacts:
    - **Overwrite:** Replaces existing data with the new data.
    - **Fill only if empty:** Only adds data if the field is currently blank.
    - **Skip:** Ignores the new data for that field if the contact already exists.

</Step>

<Step title="5. Assign to a Contact List">
Every contact you import must be assigned to at least one list.
- **Select an existing list:** Choose from your current contact lists.
- **Create a new list:** Click the **"Create A List"** button and give your new list a name.

![The list selection screen during import.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/1c675899-ba0f-4b31-9642-94320e89242b_list_selection_upload.png)

Once you've selected a list, click **Upload**.
</Step>
</Steps>

## After the Upload

After clicking **Upload**, AdsEra will process your file. You will receive a **confirmation report** detailing the number of **successful** and **failed** imports, along with specific reasons for any failures.

### Troubleshooting Common Errors

| Common Error | Description & Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Missing Identifier** | A row in your file is missing both an email and a phone number. **Solution:** Ensure every contact has a valid value in either the `EMAIL` or `PHONE` column. |
| **Incorrect File Type** | You've uploaded a file that isn't a CSV or XLSX. **Solution:** Ensure your file is saved in either `.csv` or `.xlsx` format. |
| **File Corrupted** | AdsEra could not read the file. **Solution:** Open your file in a spreadsheet program and save it again as a new, clean CSV or XLSX. |
| **Missing Headers** | Your file is missing the first row of column headers. **Solution:** Ensure your very first row contains clear column headers. |
