### Benefits of Using the Verified View
- **Improved Deliverability:** Sending emails to verified addresses dramatically reduces your bounce rates, protecting your sender reputation.
- **Enhanced Compliance:** Ensures you are contacting users with valid email accounts, which is a crucial best practice.

### Understanding the Verified View
The table in this view contains the same powerful features as the "All Audience" table, including inline editing, column customization, and bulk actions.

<Info>
  **Note:** The filter for `Email Status is Verified` is automatically applied on this page. You do not need to add it manually. Any additional filters you apply will be layered on top of this default rule.

A primary use case for this view is to create and run campaigns exclusively for your most engaged and reachable audience, leading to better overall performance.
