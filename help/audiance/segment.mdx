**Segments** are dynamic groups of contacts created by applying and saving filters in the [All Audience](/help/audiance/audiance) view. Think of them as living, breathing subdivisions of your audience that automatically update based on the criteria you define. They are a powerful tool for precision targeting.

### Understanding How Segments Work

<CardGroup>
    <Card title="Always Dynamic" icon="arrows-rotate">
        Segments are not static snapshots. They update in real-time. If a contact's data changes to meet a segment's criteria, they are added. If they no longer meet the criteria, they are removed automatically.

    <Card title="Created from Filters" icon="filter">
        Segments are born from the filter builder on the **All Audience** page. This is where you define the rules. The Segments page is for viewing and managing the segments you've already saved.

## Managing Your Segments

The Segments page provides a clean overview of all the dynamic segments you've created.

#### The Segments Table
The table displays your segments with the following columns:
- **Segment name:** The name you assigned when creating the segment.
- **Created At:** The date and time the segment was originally saved.
- **Updated At:** The date and time the segment was last modified.
- **Contacts:** A **dynamic count** of contacts who currently match the segment's criteria. This number can change frequently.

#### Segment Actions (The â‹® Menu)
Clicking the three-dot menu on any segment row reveals several actions:
- **Rename:** Opens a modal to change the segment's display name.
- **Duplicate:** Creates a new segment with the exact same filter rules, which you can then modify.
- **Add to Sequence:** Adds all contacts **currently matching** the segment to a specific automation sequence.
- **Delete:** Permanently removes the segment's definition. 
  <Warning>Deleting a segment **does not** delete any contacts from your audience. It only removes the saved set of rules.</Warning>
