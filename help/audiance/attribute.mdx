Contact attributes are custom fields used to store additional information about your contacts beyond standard details like email and name. Think of them as personalized data points such as job title, city, product preferences, or subscription tier.

**Want to manage Attributes? [Go to the AdsEra Attributes Settings &rarr;](https://app.adsera.in/dashboard/contact/attributes)**

These attributes are incredibly powerful, enabling you to:
- **Personalize** your email and WhatsApp content for a more individual touch.
- **Create** highly specific segments for targeted campaigns.
- **Refine** your targeting in automation sequences.
