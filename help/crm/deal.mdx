The **Deals** page is the heart of your CRM, providing a visual representation of your sales process. Here, you can track the progress of each sales opportunity (a "deal") as it moves through the stages of your [Pipelines](/crm/pipelines), from initial contact to a final win or loss.

### List View vs. Kanban View

You can visualize your deals in two different ways using the toggle buttons at the top of the page:

- **List View (üìù):** A traditional table layout that provides a detailed, sortable list of all your deals. This view is great for seeing specific data points like `Subtotal`, `Discount`, and `GST` in a structured format.
- **Kanban View (üìã):** A visual board that organizes your deals into columns representing each stage of your selected pipeline. This is the default and most popular view for tracking sales flow.

## The Kanban View

The Kanban view is designed for an active, visual approach to sales management.

#### Filtering Your View
At the top of the board, you can filter the deals that are displayed:
- **Select a Pipeline:** Choose which sales pipeline you want to view from the dropdown. The columns on the board will update to show the stages of the selected pipeline.
- **Date Range Filters:** Filter deals by their **Create Date** or **Close Date**.
- **Search:** Find a specific deal by its name or description.

#### Anatomy of a Kanban Column
Each column on the board represents a **stage** from your selected pipeline (e.g., `Created`, `Demo`, `Negotiation`).
- **Stage Title & Deal Count:** The header of each column shows the stage name and the number of deals currently in it.
- **Total & Weighted Value:** At the bottom of each column, you'll find:
    - **Total:** The sum of the total value of all deals in that stage.
    - **Weighted:** The total value multiplied by the stage's win probability (set in the [Pipeline settings](/crm/pipelines)). This provides a forecast of expected revenue.

#### Managing Deals with Drag-and-Drop
The power of the Kanban view is its simplicity. To move a deal from one stage to the next, simply **click and drag the deal card** and drop it into a new column. The Total and Weighted values for the columns will update automatically.
