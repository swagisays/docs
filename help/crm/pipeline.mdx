**Pipelines** are the foundation of your sales process in the AdsEra CRM. They provide a visual representation of your sales cycle, allowing you to track the progress of **Deals** as they move through different stages, from a new lead to a won customer.

## Creating and Editing a Pipeline

Clicking the **"+ New Pipeline"** button or editing an existing one opens a side panel where you can define the pipeline's structure.

A pipeline consists of a name and a series of stages that a deal will move through.

### 1. Naming Your Pipeline
The first step is to give your pipeline a clear, descriptive name that reflects its purpose, such as "Standard Sales Process" or "Partnership Pipeline".

### 2. Defining Pipeline Stages
Stages represent the key milestones in your sales process. You can add, reorder, and customize each stage. For each stage, you must define:
- **Stage Title:** A short, clear name for the stage (e.g., `New Lead`, `Demo Scheduled`, `Contract Sent`).
- **Stage Type (Probability):** The likelihood of a deal in this stage being won, expressed as a percentage (e.g., `10%`, `50%`, `90%`). This is used for sales forecasting. You can also select `won` or `lost` for the final stages.

#### Managing Stages
- **Add a Stage:** Click the **"+ Add Stage"** button to add a new row to your pipeline.
- **Reorder Stages:** Use the drag-and-drop handles to rearrange the order of your stages to match your sales workflow.
- **Delete a Stage:** Click the **trash can icon (üóëÔ∏è)** to remove a stage.
  <Warning>
    Deleting a stage with active deals will require you to move those deals to another stage.
  </Warning>

Once you've defined your pipeline name and all its stages, click **"Create Pipeline"** or **"Save Changes"** to finish.

## How Pipelines Work with Deals

<Card title="The Heart of Your CRM" icon="handshake">
  The pipelines you create here are the framework for managing your sales opportunities. Each opportunity is represented as a **Deal**, which is then placed in a specific stage of a pipeline. As the deal progresses, you simply drag and drop it from one stage to the next, giving your entire team a real-time visual update on your sales efforts.
