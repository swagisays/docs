### How Products Integrate with Deals

The primary purpose of creating products in AdsEra is to link them to your sales process.

<Card title="Connecting Products to Deals" icon="handshake">
  When you create or edit a **Deal** in one of your [Pipelines](/crm/pipelines), you can associate one or more of these products with it. This helps you:
  - Automatically calculate the deal's total value.
  - Track which products are selling the most.
  - Provide your sales team with clear information about what's included in each potential sale.
