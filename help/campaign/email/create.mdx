Creating a campaign in AdsEra involves a structured process, breaking down the task into manageable sections: **Name**, **Sender**, **Recipients**, **Design**, **Reply to**, and **Schedule**. Each step is designed to give you precise control over your campaign's identity, content, audience, and timing.

## Building Your Campaign: Step-by-Step

After navigating to the **Campaigns** then **Email** page and clicking **"+ New campaign"**, you will be guided through the following setup wizard.

![The campaign creation wizard interface.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/114a892e-5893-4679-89b7-84326bbec790_campaign_e_create.png)

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Name Your Campaign">
  This is an internal name for easy identification within AdsEra (e.g., "Summer Sale Q3 2025," "July Newsletter"). It is not visible to recipients. The name can be up to 150 characters.
</Step>
<Step title="2. Choose Your Sender">
  This section defines the "From Name" and "From Email" that your recipients will see. Select a pre-verified sender from the dropdown menu.

  <Info>
    **Pro Tip:** Always use a recognizable and professional sender name and email to build trust and improve open rates. Avoid "no-reply" addresses.
  </Info>
</Step>
<Step title="3. Define Your Recipients">
  This is a critical step where you select who will receive your campaign. AdsEra offers powerful options for targeting:
  - **Select Lists:** Choose one or more of your static contact lists.
  - **Select Segments:** Target dynamic, rule-based segments of your contacts (e.g., "Engaged Subscribers").
  - **Filter Recipients (Advanced):** For the most granular control, build a custom filter for this specific campaign using various contact attributes and `AND`/`OR` logic.
  
  For more on this, see our guide on [All Audience & Segments](/audience/all).
</Step>
<Step title="4. Select your Channel">
  This crucial step determines the type of campaign you will create. Choose the channel your audience prefers for the best engagement. The options you see in later steps, such as design and sender selection, will change based on your choice here.


  <CardGroup>
    <Card title="Email" icon="envelope">
      Select this option to create a traditional email campaign. You will design rich HTML content, choose from your verified email senders, and track metrics like opens and clicks.
    </Card>
    <Card title="WhatsApp" icon="whatsapp" iconType="brands">
      Select this option to send a message directly to contacts on WhatsApp. You will use pre-approved Message Templates and can leverage rich media for high-impact, conversational messaging.
    </Card>
  </CardGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="5. Design Your Email Content">
  Click **"Start designing"** to create your email. You have several options:
  - **Layouts:** Start with a basic structural layout.
  - **Template Gallery:** Select from AdsEra's collection of professionally pre-built, customizable templates.
  - **My Templates:** Reuse any of your previously saved templates for brand consistency.
  - **Code Your Own:** For advanced users, use the intuitive drag-and-drop **Email Builder** or directly **Paste your code** in the HTML editor.
</Step>
<Step title="6. Set Your Reply-To Address">
  Specify where you want to receive replies. It's best to use an email address that is actively monitored by your team to enable prompt engagement with interested recipients.
</Step>
<Step title="7. Schedule Your Campaign">
  Decide when your campaign will be sent.
  - **Send Immediately:** To send the campaign as soon as you finish the setup.
  - **Schedule for a Future Date/Time:** Pick a specific date and time for delivery, allowing you to plan ahead and optimize send times for your audience.
</Step>
<Step title="8. Preview & Test (Highly Recommended!)">
  Before launching, click the **"Preview & test"** button in the top right. Send a test email to yourself to check:
  - Subject lines and preheaders.
  - Content formatting and image display.
  - That all links are working correctly.
  - That personalization tags (like `{{FIRSTNAME}}`) are populating as expected.
</Step>
</Steps>
