## Anatomy of a Campaign Card

Each card on your Campaign List represents an individual email campaign and provides key information at a glance. Here's a detailed breakdown of what you'll see:

| Section | Field / Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Header** | **Campaign Name** | The internal name you assigned to your campaign for easy identification. |
| | **Sent On / Last Updated** | The date and time the campaign was sent. For drafts, this shows the last update time. |
| | **Status Tag** | A color-coded tag indicating the campaign's current status: <br/>- `DRAFT`: Created but not yet sent. <br/>- `SENT`: Successfully sent to your recipients. <br/>- `FAILED`: Encountered an error and could not be sent. |
| **Details** | **Sender** | The email address from which the campaign was sent (e.g., `info@adsera.in`). |
| | **Template** | The name of the email template used for the campaign. |
| **Metrics** | **Recipients** | The total number of unique contacts the campaign was intended for. |
| | **Openers** | The number of unique recipients who opened your email. |
| | **Clickers**| The number of unique recipients who clicked at least one link. |
| | **Failure**| The number of emails that failed to deliver (e.g., bounced). |

## Searching and Filtering Your Campaigns

To help you find specific campaigns quickly, you can filter your list by a date range at the top of the page.

1.  Click on the **Start** date field to open a calendar and select a beginning date.
2.  Click on the **End** date field to open a calendar and select an end date.

This will instantly update the list to show only campaigns sent within that specific period, which is especially helpful for quarterly or monthly performance reviews.
