## Understanding the Report Interface

At the top of your report, you'll find essential campaign details and a graph filter that applies to all tabs.

![The Campaign Report overview.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/f11bf242-5682-4f02-93e9-4ad00035ef7c_campaign_report.png)

- **Campaign Details:** Includes the **Subject**, **From** address, and **Reply to** address.
- **Graph Filter:** Allows you to view performance data over specific timeframes: **1 Hour**, **6 Hours**, **24 Hours**, or a **custom date range**.

The main report is divided into the following tabs:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Overview">
  The **Overview** tab is your go-to for a quick summary of your campaign's key performance indicators (KPIs).

  | Metric | Definition & Interpretation |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | **Delivery Rate** | The percentage of emails that were successfully delivered. A high rate (ideally 98%+) indicates a healthy contact list. |
  | **Trackable Open Rate** | The percentage of *delivered* emails that were opened. This is a crucial metric for measuring your subject line's effectiveness. |
  | **Click-through Rate** | The percentage of *delivered* emails that resulted in at least one unique click. This measures how effective your content and calls-to-action (CTAs) are. |
  | **Unsubscribe Rate** | The percentage of delivered emails that resulted in an unsubscribe. A low rate suggests your content is relevant to your audience. |
  | **Spam Complaint Rate** | The percentage of delivered emails marked as spam. Keep this as low as possible, as it directly impacts your sender reputation. |

  Below these metrics, a graph visualizes key activities (Opens, Clicks, Bounces, etc.) over time.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Deliverability">
  This tab provides a detailed breakdown of your email delivery success. It shows the total **Recipients**, how many emails were **Sent**, and how many were successfully **Delivered**.

  <Card title="Smart Segregation: Delivered Audience" icon="address-book">
    This section lists all contacts who received your email. You can select contacts from this list and click **"Create New List"** to generate a new, targeted list of successfully reached users.
  </Card>

  You'll also see a breakdown of bounces:
  - **Soft Bounces:** Emails that were temporarily undeliverable (e.g., mailbox full).
  - **Hard Bounces:** Emails that are permanently undeliverable (e.g., invalid address). These contacts are automatically suppressed to protect your sender reputation.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Opens & Clicks">
  These tabs offer a granular view of user engagement.
  
  #### Opens
  See the total opens vs. unique opens, your open rate, and the last open time. The list below shows exactly who opened your email and when.

  #### Clicks
  This is where you measure direct interaction.
  - **Key Metrics:** Track total clicks, unique clicks, click-to-open rate (CTOR), and average time to click. A high CTOR indicates very effective content.
  - **Click Breakdown:** See which **Browsers**, **Countries**, and **Operating Systems** your audience uses.
  - **Link Performance:** The "Smart Segregation" table shows which specific **Links** each contact clicked, helping you identify your most popular content.

  <Info>
    You can create a new list of contacts who opened or clicked your campaign directly from these tabs, allowing for powerful re-engagement campaigns.
  </Info>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Unsubscribe">
  This tab provides crucial information on recipients who opted out or marked your email as spam.
  
  <Warning>
    **Monitor These Metrics Closely!** A high "Unsubscribe rate" or "Spam complaint rate" can seriously harm your sender reputation and future deliverability. If these numbers are high, review your content, audience targeting, and sending frequency.
  </Warning>

  The list in this tab shows you exactly who unsubscribed or complained, helping you maintain a clean and engaged audience.

</Tabs>
