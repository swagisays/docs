## Understanding the Report Interface

At the top of your report, you'll find a preview of your message, essential campaign details, and a graph filter that applies to all tabs.

![The WhatsApp Campaign Report overview.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/609f53d0-fddb-4e8c-931c-4967419c5f47_wa_report.png)

- **Campaign Details:** Includes the **Campaign Name**, **Sent On** time, the **Template** used, and the sending **Channel** (WABA).
- **Graph Filter:** Allows you to view performance data over specific timeframes: **1 Hour**, **6 Hours**, **24 Hours**, or a **custom date range**.

The main report is divided into the following tabs, each providing a unique view of your campaign's performance:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Overview">
  The **Overview** tab provides a high-level summary of your campaign's key performance indicators (KPIs).

  | Metric | Description & Interpretation |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | **Total Sent** | The total number of messages dispatched from AdsEra. |
  | **Delivered To** | The number of messages successfully delivered to recipients' devices. A high delivery rate is key. |
  | **Read** | The number of unique recipients who have read your message (indicated by blue ticks). This measures engagement. |
  | **Replies**| The number of unique contacts who replied to your campaign message. |
  | **Failed** | The number of messages that failed to deliver (e.g., invalid number). |
  | **Subscribed** | The number of users who opted-in as a result of this campaign. |
  | **Unsubscribed** | The number of users who opted-out after receiving this campaign. |

  Below the metrics, a graph visualizes these key activities over time, helping you identify trends.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Deliverability">
  This tab provides a detailed breakdown of your message delivery success. You can see the total **Recipients**, how many messages were **Sent**, and how many were successfully **Delivered**.

  <Card title="Smart Segregation: Delivered Audience" icon="address-book">
    This section lists all contacts who received your message. You can filter this list by read status (`Has Read` / `Has not Read`) and by time frame. Use the checkboxes to select contacts and click **"Retargeting"** to create a new campaign for this specific audience.
  </Card>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Read">
 This tab focuses on who has seen your message. It shows the total number of **Recipients**, how many have been **Delivered** to, and the final count of contacts who have **Read** the message. The **Read Rate** gives you a clear percentage of engagement. The list below allows you to segment and retarget users based on their read status.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Replies">
  This tab is crucial for measuring direct engagement and conversation starters. It shows the number of recipients who **Read** the message versus how many sent a **Reply**. The **Reply Rate** is a powerful indicator of how compelling your message and call-to-action were.

  <Info>
  The **Smart Segregation** table on this tab shows the exact reply message (`Reply Msg`) from each contact, giving you direct insight into customer responses.
  </Info>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Failed">
  This tab lists all the contacts to whom the message could not be delivered. Reviewing this list is important for maintaining a clean and effective contact database. The table will show the contact details and the specific **Fail Reason** for each, helping you diagnose issues with invalid numbers.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Subscribed & Unsubscribed">
  These tabs help you track changes in your audience's consent status resulting from this campaign.
  - **Subscribed:** Lists any contacts who opted-in.
  - **Unsubscribed:** Lists any contacts who opted-out. Monitoring this tab is critical for understanding if your content is meeting audience expectations.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Pro Tips for Analyzing Your Reports

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Focus on the Read Rate" icon="eye">
    Unlike email, WhatsApp's read receipts give you a very accurate measure of engagement. A high delivery rate but a low read rate might indicate that your message was sent at a bad time or that the contact is no longer active.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analyze Replies for Insights" icon="lightbulb">
    The "Replies" tab is a goldmine of customer feedback. Analyze the `Reply Msg` column to understand customer questions, feedback, and interest levels, which can inform your next campaign.
  </Card>
   <Card title="Use Smart Segregation for Retargeting" icon="layer-group">
    The "Retargeting" button is a powerful feature. Create follow-up campaigns for users who **read but did not reply**, or for those who **replied with specific keywords**, to create highly personalized customer journeys.
