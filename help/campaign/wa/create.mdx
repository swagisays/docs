## Building Your WhatsApp Campaign

After navigating to the **Campaigns > WhatsApp** page and clicking **"+ New campaign"**, you will be guided through the following setup wizard.

![The WhatsApp campaign creation wizard.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/27585794-0e60-45f3-a722-c9edd9d9efa8_camp_wa_create.png)

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Name Your Campaign">
  This is an internal name for easy identification within AdsEra (e.g., "Post-Purchase Follow-Up," "Diwali Sale Offer"). It is not visible to recipients. The name can be up to 150 characters.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Define Your Recipients">
  This is where you select who will receive your campaign. AdsEra offers powerful segmentation options:
  - **Select Lists:** Choose one or more of your static contact lists.
  - **Select Segments:** Target dynamic, rule-based segments of your contacts.
  - **Filter Recipients (Advanced):** Build a custom, one-time filter for this specific campaign using various contact attributes and `AND`/`OR` logic.

  For more details, see our guide on [All Audience & Segments](/audience/all).
</Step>

<Step title="3. Select Your Channel (WABA)">
  Choose the specific WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) number you want to send this campaign from. This is especially important if you manage multiple numbers for different brands or departments.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Choose Your Message Template">
  All WhatsApp campaigns must use a Message Template that has been pre-approved by Meta.
  - Click **"Manage template"** to open a gallery of your approved templates.
  - Browse or search for the template you wish to use.
  - If the template includes variables (e.g., `{{name}}`), you will be prompted to provide values for them in a subsequent step to personalize the message for each recipient.
</Step>

<Step title="5. Schedule Your Campaign">
  Decide when your campaign will be sent.
  - **Send Immediately:** To send the campaign as soon as you finish the setup.
  - **Schedule for Later:** Pick a specific future date and time for delivery.
</Step>

<Step title="6. Create Your Campaign">
  Once all the steps are configured and show a green checkmark, the **"Create"** button at the top of the page will become active. Click it to finalize and either send or schedule your campaign.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Important Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding Message Templates">
    WhatsApp requires that all business-initiated conversations use pre-approved Message Templates to prevent spam and ensure a high-quality user experience. These templates can include text, rich media (images/videos), and interactive buttons.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personalization with Variables">
    Using variables like `{{FIRSTNAME}}` or `{{order_id}}` in your templates is key to creating personalized and engaging messages. When you select a template with variables, AdsEra will guide you through mapping these to the corresponding contact attributes.
