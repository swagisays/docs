**Snippets** are pre-written, reusable message blocks that your agents can quickly insert into conversations in the **WhatsApp Chat Inbox**. Think of them as "quick replies" for your most common questions and responses.

Using snippets is a powerful way to:
- **Save Time:** Drastically reduce the time it takes to answer frequently asked questions.
- **Ensure Consistency:** Maintain a consistent brand voice and ensure accuracy across all agent responses.
- **Improve Efficiency:** Allow your team to handle more conversations by streamlining their workflow.
