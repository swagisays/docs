The inbox is organized into three main panels: the **Conversation List**, the **Chat Window**, and the **Contact Details** panel. Each is packed with tools to make your workflow faster and more organized.

## 1. The Conversation List (Left Panel)

This panel on the left displays all your ongoing conversations. It's designed to help you quickly find and prioritize customer chats.

#### WABA Selector
At the very top, you'll find a dropdown menu to select your **WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)**. If you have multiple WhatsApp numbers connected to AdsEra, you can switch between them here to view and respond from the correct number.

#### Searching and Advanced Filtering
- **Simple Search:** Use the **Search contacts...** bar to quickly find a conversation by name or phone number.
- **Advanced Filters:** Click the **filter icon** (ᯤ) next to the search bar to open the "Chat Filters" modal. This powerful tool allows you to create specific views of your inbox based on multiple criteria.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Filter by Status">
    - **Chat Status:** Find conversations that are `All`, `Open`, `Closed`, or part of a `Broadcast`.
    - **Read Status:** Isolate `All`, `Read`, or `Unread` messages.
    - **Conversation Window:** Filter for `All`, `Active` (within the 24-hour window), or `Expired` conversations.

    For the most granular control, you can build your own filter logic:

    2.  Choose an operator (e.g., "is equal to", "contains").
    3.  Provide a value to filter by.

## 2. The Chat Window (Center Panel)

This is where the direct interaction with your customer happens.

#### Chat Header
- **Contact Info:** Shows the name and avatar of the customer.
- **Message Search:** Click the **search icon** to find specific text within the current conversation history.
- **24-Hour Session Timer:** A circular progress bar that shows how much time is left in WhatsApp's 24-hour customer service window.
- **Contact Details:** Click the **information icon (`ⓘ`)** to open the full Contact Details panel on the right.

#### Message Timeline & Status
To see the exact delivery timeline of a message you've sent, **hover over the message bubble**. An **info icon (`ⓘ`)** will appear. Clicking it opens a "Message info" drawer from the left.

![The Message Info timeline drawer.](https://sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/whatsera/04d108b9-cf60-4224-93f2-b9f30fa247e5_msg_timeline.png)

This drawer shows the precise timestamps for each status:
- **Sent:** The time the message left AdsEra's servers.
- **Delivered:** The time the message was successfully delivered to the recipient's device.
- **Read:** The time the recipient opened and read the message.

#### The Message Composer
This is where you write your replies. The composer's functionality changes based on the 24-hour session window.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Active Conversation (Within 24 Hours)">
    While the session timer is active, you have full access to the composer:
    - **Text Area:** Type any free-form message up to 4096 characters.
    - **Attachments:** Send rich media like **images (5MB)**, **videos (16MB)**, **audio (16MB)**, or **documents (100MB)**.
    - **Snippets & Templates:** Use quick replies or pre-approved templates to respond faster.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Expired Conversation (After 24 Hours)">
    Once the 24-hour window closes, the normal text area is disabled. You will see a message explaining that you must use a template to re-initiate the conversation. Your only option is to click the **Send Template** button.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Using Snippets and Message Templates

  <Accordion title="Using Snippets (Quick Replies)">
    Snippets are saved, reusable text blocks for answering common questions quickly and consistently.
