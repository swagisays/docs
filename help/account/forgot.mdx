## Password Reset Process

The process involves two main stages: requesting the reset link and creating your new password.

<Steps>
<Step title="Request a Password Reset Link">
  On the "Forgot Password" page, you'll see a field to enter your email.

  1.  In the **Email address** field, type the email associated with your AdsEra account.
  2.  Click the **Send Request** button.

  A confirmation will appear, and a password reset link will be sent to your email inbox.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Your Email for the Reset Link">
  Open your email client and look for a new email from AdsEra.

  <Warning>
    The password reset link is only **valid for 10 minutes**. If you don't use it within that time, you'll need to start the process over.
    
    If you can't find the email, please check your spam or junk folder.
  </Warning>

  Click the reset link in the email to proceed to the final step.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Your New Password">
  Clicking the link will take you to the "Create your new password" page. Your email address will be pre-filled and disabled for security.

  1.  In the **Password** field, enter your new, secure password.
  2.  In the **Confirm New Password** field, enter the same password again to ensure it's correct.
  3.  Click the **Update Password** button.
</Step>
