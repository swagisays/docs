## Opt-Out Settings

This section controls how users can automatically unsubscribe from your messages.

<Card title="Opt-Out Keywords" icon="comment-slash">
  Here you can define a list of keywords that will automatically trigger an opt-out. When a user sends a message containing one of these exact keywords (e.g., `STOP`), their WhatsApp subscription status will be updated to "unsubscribed."

  - **To add a keyword:** Type it into the "Enter keywords" field and click **Add**.
  - **To remove a keyword:** Click the `x` on the keyword's chip.
</Card>

#### Opt-Out Matching Method
You can choose how strictly the system matches the keywords sent by users:
- **Fuzzy matching:** Allows for minor misspellings.
- **Exact matching:** The user's message must match your keyword perfectly.
- **Contains:** The user's message must contain your keyword anywhere within it.

#### Opt-Out Response Message
You can configure an automatic message that is sent to a user immediately after they opt out.
- **Enable/Disable:** Use the toggle switch to turn this automated response on or off.
- **Configure:** Click the **"Configure"** button to edit the content of the response message. A common best practice is to confirm the unsubscribe action and let them know how to re-subscribe, as shown in the preview.

## Opt-In Settings

This section controls how users can subscribe or re-subscribe to your WhatsApp messages.

<Card title="Opt-In Keywords" icon="comment-dots">
  Define a list of keywords that will automatically opt a user in. When a user who is not currently subscribed sends one of these keywords (e.g., `START`), their WhatsApp subscription status will be set to "subscribed."

  - **To add a keyword:** Type it into the "Enter keywords" field and click **Add**.
  - **To remove a keyword:** Click the `x` on the keyword's chip.
</Card>

#### Opt-In Matching Method
Similar to the opt-out settings, you can define the logic for matching keywords: `fuzzy matching`, `exact matching`, or `contains`.

#### Opt-In Response Message
Set up an automated welcome message for new subscribers.
- **Enable/Disable:** Use the toggle switch to turn this automated welcome message on or off.
- **Configure:** Click the **"Configure"** button to edit the content of the response message. This is a great place to thank the user for subscribing and set expectations.
