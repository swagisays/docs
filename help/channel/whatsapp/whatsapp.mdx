## Pro Tips

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Monitor Your Quality Rating" icon="shield-halved">
    Regularly check your WhatsApp Rating. A `GREEN` (High Quality) rating ensures the best deliverability. If your rating drops to yellow or red, it's a sign to review your messaging strategy to avoid being blocked by Meta.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep Your Profile Current" icon="info-circle">
    Your WhatsApp profile is often a direct point of contact for customers. Ensure your "About" text, website, and contact details are always up-to-date to provide a professional and trustworthy experience.
