Connecting a new WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) to AdsEra is a streamlined process that uses Meta's secure **Embedded Signup** pop-up window. This guide will walk you through the prerequisites and steps to get your new number live.

### Before You Begin: The 3 Essentials

To ensure a smooth setup, please complete the following steps first.

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Prepare Your Meta Business Manager">
You must have an **admin account** for your Meta Business Manager. This is required to grant the necessary permissions. If you don't have one, you can create it at [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com).
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Prepare a Fresh Phone Number">
The phone number you intend to use must meet these criteria:
- It is **not** currently registered on the personal WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business app.
- It can receive an OTP (One-Time Password) via SMS or a voice call.
- It will be used exclusively for the WhatsApp API.

<Warning>
  If you use a number that was previously active on WhatsApp, your old chats, groups, and contact history **will not** be synced or restored. The number will start completely fresh on the API.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Prepare Your Business Details">
Have the following information ready, as you will need it during the setup process:
- A professional **Display Name** that clearly represents your brand.
- Your official **Business Website URL**.
</Step>
</Steps>
