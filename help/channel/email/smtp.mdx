**Want to Setup Email SMTP/IMAP? [Go to the AdsEra Email Sender Page &rarr;](https://app.adsera.in/dashboard/channel/email)**


For each sender you create in AdsEra, you can generate a unique set of SMTP and IMAP credentials. This allows you to configure your sender email address in external applications (like Gmail, Outlook, or Thunderbird) to send and receive emails through AdsEra's servers.

### Accessing Your Credentials

  The SMTP/IMAP credentials allow you to use your sender address in third-party email clients like **Thunderbird** or **Outlook**. You can also use them to manage replies in our own [AdsEra Mail Inbox](https://mail.adsera.in).
