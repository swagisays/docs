The **Email Channel** page is where you manage the foundation of your email marketing identity. It's split into two key areas:
- **Domains:** Authenticating the domains you send emails from (e.g., `yourbrand.com`).
- **Senders:** Creating the specific "From" email addresses and names your audience will see (e.g., `support@adsera.in`).

Properly configuring both is crucial for improving deliverability, protecting your brand, and landing your messages in the inbox.

<Tab title="Domains">

Your sending domain is your unique address on the internet. Authenticating it tells email providers like Gmail and Outlook that you are a legitimate sender.

### How to Add and Authenticate a Domain

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Add Your Domain">
Click the **"+ Add Domain"** button. In the pop-up, enter your domain name (e.g., `my-awesome-brand.com`) and click **"Add Domain"**.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Add DNS Records to Your Domain Provider">
AdsEra will provide four types of DNS records. You must add these records to the DNS settings of the provider where your domain is hosted (like GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.).

- **Authenticate Yourself:** Copy the Hostname and Value for each record and paste them into your DNS panel.
- **Send to a Colleague:** Email the setup instructions directly to your developer or IT team.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Verify Authentication">
DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally. Once they do, the **Domain Status** in the table will change to a green **"Authenticated"**. You can click the **"Authenticate"** action to trigger a manual re-check.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tab title="Senders">

A **Sender** is the combination of a "From Name" and "From Email" that your audience sees in their inbox (e.g., "Shubham from AdsEra" `<shubham@adsera.in>`).

### How to Add a Sender

1.  Click the **“+ Add Sender”** button.
2.  In the pop-up, fill in the details:
    - **From Name:** The name your recipients will see (e.g., `MyCompany Newsletter`).
    - **From Email:** The email address you will send from.
    - **Choose a Domain:** Select one of your **verified** domains from the dropdown list.
3.  Click **Save**.

<Warning>
  You must successfully **verify a domain first** before you can add a sender email address that uses it.
</Warning>

### Managing Senders

The Senders table lists all your created sender identities. From the actions menu for each sender, you can:
- **✏️ Edit:** Change the "From Name" of an existing sender.
- **✉️ Get SMTP/IMAP Credentials:** Click the **email icon** to navigate to a dedicated page where you can view and manage the SMTP and IMAP credentials for that specific sender address.

<Card title="Use Your Senders Anywhere" icon="envelope">
  The SMTP/IMAP credentials allow you to use your sender address in third-party email clients like **Thunderbird** or **Outlook**. You can also use them to manage replies in our own [AdsEra Mail Inbox](https://mail.adsera.in).
