## Who is AdsEra For?

AdsEra is built for a diverse range of users who need reliable, insightful, and multi-channel communication tools. This includes:

- **Developers:** Easily integrate our transactional email and WhatsApp systems into your applications for notifications, password resets, order confirmations, and other automated communications.
- **Real Estate Agents:** Send out property updates, newsletters, and targeted campaigns to your clients and leads via both email and WhatsApp.
- **Marketers:** Launch effective broadcast campaigns on email and WhatsApp, nurture leads across channels, and track your performance with precision.
