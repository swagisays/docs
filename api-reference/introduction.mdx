## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using a unique `App Id` and `App Secret` pair. These credentials must be included as custom headers in **every** API request you send.

<Note>
  Your `App Id` and `App Secret` can be generated from the [**API Settings**](https://app.adsera.in/dashboard/user/account?tab=API%20Key) section of your AdsEra panel. Keep them secure and do not share them publicly.
</Note>

Here is the required format for the request headers:

```http
# Required Headers for Every API Call

x-api-key: YOUR_APP_ID
x-api-secret: YOUR_APP_SECRET
```
